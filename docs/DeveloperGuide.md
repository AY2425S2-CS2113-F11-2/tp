## 3. Design

---

### 3.1.0 UI Class

This class displays system output messages whenever an action has occurred or invoked by the user using the listed commands.

### Methods

#### `handleUserInput()`

This method continuously prompts the user for input and processes commands accordingly. It ensures that the application runs until the user chooses to exit.

#### Functionality:

1. Displays a prompt for the user to enter a command.
2. Reads user input if available.
3. Calls `processCommand` to handle the command.
4. Displays a divider after processing each command (if still running).
5. If no input is available, it displays an empty input message and stops execution.

### `processCommand()`

This method processes user input by mapping commands to their corresponding functionalities. The commands are predefined in the `Commands` class.

#### Functionality:

1. Trims and converts user input to lowercase.
2. Uses a `switch` statement to execute the appropriate method based on the input.
3. Handles multiple functionalities, including expense management, group operations, currency conversion, and data export.
4. Displays an error message for invalid commands.

### 3.1.1 DataStorage Class

The data storage class initializes the expense.txt file to store expenses created by the user on app start-up and its contents
are saved upon exit.

### File Handling

- **Data File:** The expense data is stored in `expenses.txt`.
- **Separator:** Each entry in the file is delimited using `|`.
- **Assertions:** Used to ensure correct program behavior.

### Methods

#### `ensureFileExists()`

Ensures that the data file exists. If the file does not exist, it is created.

- Uses `File.createNewFile()`.
- Prints a message if a new file is created.
- Handles `IOException` in case of errors.
- Assertion: Checks that the file exists after execution.

#### `saveExpenses(List<Expense> expenses)`

Saves a list of expenses to the data file.

- Iterates through `expenses` and writes each expense to `expenses.txt`.
- Each expense is stored with attributes separated by `|`.
- Returns `true` if saving is successful, `false` otherwise.
- Handles `IOException`.
- Assertion: Ensures `expenses` is not null before execution.

#### `loadExpenses()`

Loads expenses from the data file.

- Reads each line and splits it using `|`.
- Extracts attributes and creates `Expense` objects.
- Returns a list of `Expense` objects.
- Handles `FileNotFoundException`.

#### `resetExpenses()`

Clears all data in `expenses.txt`. Used mainly for testing.

- Writes an empty string to the file.
- Handles `IOException`.
- Assertion: Ensures the file is empty after reset.

### 3.1.2 GroupStorage Class

User-created groups are stored here, each containing the names of the members to be assigned an expense.

### 3.1.3 Commands Class

All approved commands that can be used within the application are stored here as macros. The UI class contains a switch-case block
that checks if the user input matches any of these commands and handles invalid commands.

#### Command List

### 3.1.5 FriendsCommands Class

####

### 3.1.6 SplitCommand Class

The **SplitCommand** class is responsible for managing the splitting of expenses among group members.
It enables users to select an expense from a list and split that expense among a group either equally or through a manual assignment, either via absolute amounts or percentages.

---

#### Key Features

- **Expense Selection:**

  - Displays a list of available expenses.
  - Allows the user to choose an expense by entering its corresponding number.

- **Splitting Options:**

  - **Equal Split:**  
    Divides the selected expense evenly among all members of the chosen group.
  - **Manual Split:**  
    Requires the user to select a single splitting mode for the entire group:
    - **Absolute Mode:**
      - The user assigns a fixed monetary amount to each member.
    - **Percentage Mode:**
      - The user assigns a percentage for each member.

- **Automatic Balance Display:**
  - Once the split is completed, the command automatically shows cumilatively how much each member of the group owes, including from past splitting.
  - It uses the `owedAmounts.txt` file to sum all owed amounts for each member. It also displays the updated cumulative balance.

---

#### Implementation Details

- **User Input Validation:**

  - Validates the selected expense index and group name.
  - Ensures numeric inputs for amounts and percentages are valid.
  - Prevents assignments that exceed the remaining expense (in absolute mode) or cumulative percentage (in percentage mode).

- **File Handling and Persistence:**

  - Each valid assignment is appended in real time to the `owedAmounts.txt` file using a helper method.
  - The file maintains a persistent record of all split transactions.
  - When viewing a group, the system aggregates all entries per member to count the cumulative balance.

- **Integration with FriendsCommands:**

  - The SplitCommand class holds a reference to the **FriendsCommands** instance.
  - After completing the split, it calls the `viewGroupDirect(String groupName)` method to display the updated balances immediately.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Gracefully handles input errors (e.g., non-numeric values, attempts to over-assign amounts or percentages).
  - Provides clear error messages and re-prompts the user for valid input.

---

#### Workflow Summary

1. **Expense Selection:**

   - The user is presented with a list of expenses and selects one to split.

2. **Choosing a Split Option:**

   - **Equal Split:**
     - The expense is divided equally among the members of the specified group.
   - **Manual Split:**
     - The user selects one split method for the entire group (absolute or percentage).
     - **Absolute Mode:**
       - Each assignment reduces the remaining available amount.
       - The system displays the remaining unassigned amount after each entry.
     - **Percentage Mode:**
       - Each assignment reduces the available percentage from the total 100%.
       - The system displays the remaining percentage after each entry.

3. **Automatic Balance Update:**
   - After completing the split, the command automatically calls the view-group method to show each member's cumulative owed balance.
   - This balance is computed by aggregating all past and current assignments from `owedAmounts.txt`.

- Initializes a map to store the exchange rates between different currencies.
- Attempts to read current currency from the file `./currentCurrency`
- Handles any file-related issues or data retrieval failures gracefully by providing default exchange rates when necessary.

#### Initialising Exchange Rates

The `initializeExchangeRates()` method initializes currency exchange rates by adding predefined exchange rates for various currencies

- Each currency code is mapped to its corresponding exchange rate value.
- The exchange rates are hardcoded and include values for a wide range of currencies (e.g., AED, AFN, ALL, AMD, etc.).
- Ensures that the exchangeRates map is populated with accurate conversion values for use in currency calculations.

The `changeCurrency()` method handles the currency change process with these features:

- Prompts the user to choose between entering their own exchange rate (option 1) or using an estimated exchange rate (option 2).
- Handles the user's input by checking if they input '1' or '2', guiding them to make a valid choice.
- If the user selects option 1, it asks for the currency code (based on ISO 4217 standard) and validates if the currency exists in the exchangeRates map.
- In option 1, the user is also prompted to enter a custom exchange rate, which is validated and parsed.
- If the user selects option 2, it retrieves the current exchange rate for the selected currency using the getExchangeRate() method.
- If a valid exchange rate is found for the new currency, it calculates the exchange rate relative to the current currency.
- Handles NumberFormatException gracefully and prompts the user to input a valid number if there are formatting issues.
- The method invokes editExpenseCurrency() to update the expense currency with the final exchange rate and the new currency.

#### Edit Expense Currency Method

The `editExpenseCurrency()` method manages the process of updating the expense currency with these features:

- Accepts a finalExchangeRate and a newCurrency as parameters to update the expense currency.
- Calls the budgetManager.editExpenseCurrency() method to apply the new exchange rate.
- Updates the currentCurrency to the new currency.
- Attempts to write the new currency to a file using the writeToFile() method.
- Handles potential IOException by catching the error and displaying a message if there's an issue with recording the change.
- Prints a success message confirming that the currency has been successfully changed to the new currency.

#### Write to File Method

The `writeToFile()` method handles writing the new currency to a file with these features:

- Accepts a newCurrency string as a parameter to be written to a file.
- Creates a FileWriter to open the file `./currentCurrency` in write mode, with the false parameter indicating that the file will be overwritten (not appended).
- Writes the newCurrency string to the file.
- Closes the FileWriter after writing the data to ensure resources are properly released.
- Declares the IOException to be thrown, which is handled by the calling method.
