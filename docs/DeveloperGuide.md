### 3.6 FriendsCommands Class

### 3.7 SplitCommand Class

The **SplitCommand** class is responsible for managing the splitting of expenses among group members. 
It enables users to select an expense from a list and split that expense among a group either equally or through a manual assignment, either via absolute amounts or percentages.
---

#### Key Features

- **Expense Selection:**
  - Displays a list of available expenses.
  - Allows the user to choose an expense by entering its corresponding number.

- **Splitting Options:**
  - **Equal Split:**  
    Divides the selected expense evenly among all members of the chosen group.
  - **Manual Split:**  
    Requires the user to select a single splitting mode for the entire group:
    - **Absolute Mode:**  
      - The user assigns a fixed monetary amount to each member.
    - **Percentage Mode:**  
      - The user assigns a percentage for each member.

- **Automatic Balance Display:**
  - Once the split is completed, the command automatically shows cumilatively how much each member of the group owes, including from past splitting.
  - It uses the `owedAmounts.txt` file to sum all owed amounts for each member. It also displays the updated cumulative balance.

---

#### Implementation Details

- **User Input Validation:**
  - Validates the selected expense index and group name.
  - Ensures numeric inputs for amounts and percentages are valid.
  - Prevents assignments that exceed the remaining expense (in absolute mode) or cumulative percentage (in percentage mode).

- **File Handling and Persistence:**
  - Each valid assignment is appended in real time to the `owedAmounts.txt` file using a helper method.
  - The file maintains a persistent record of all split transactions.
  - When viewing a group, the system aggregates all entries per member to count the cumulative balance.

- **Integration with FriendsCommands:**
  - The SplitCommand class holds a reference to the **FriendsCommands** instance.
  - After completing the split, it calls the `viewGroupDirect(String groupName)` method to display the updated balances immediately.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Gracefully handles input errors (e.g., non-numeric values, attempts to over-assign amounts or percentages).
  - Provides clear error messages and re-prompts the user for valid input.

---

#### Workflow Summary

1. **Expense Selection:**  
   - The user is presented with a list of expenses and selects one to split.

2. **Choosing a Split Option:**
   - **Equal Split:**  
     - The expense is divided equally among the members of the specified group.
   - **Manual Split:**  
     - The user selects one split method for the entire group (absolute or percentage).
     - **Absolute Mode:**  
       - Each assignment reduces the remaining available amount.
       - The system displays the remaining unassigned amount after each entry.
     - **Percentage Mode:**  
       - Each assignment reduces the available percentage from the total 100%.
       - The system displays the remaining percentage after each entry.

3. **Automatic Balance Update:**  
   - After completing the split, the command automatically calls the view-group method to show each memberâ€™s cumulative owed balance.
   - This balance is computed by aggregating all past and current assignments from `owedAmounts.txt`.

### 4.2 GroupManager Class

### 4.3 HelpPage Class

### 4.4 Messages Class

### 4.5 ExpenseClassifier Class

### 4.6 Currency Class
The Currency class handles all currency-related operations within the application. It provides functionality for managing currency codes, conversion rates, and performing currency conversions.

#### Currency Constructor

The `Currency()` method sets up the exchange rates for different currencies with these features:

- Initializes a map to store the exchange rates between different currencies.
- Attempts to read current currency from the file `./currentCurrency`
- Handles any file-related issues or data retrieval failures gracefully by providing default exchange rates when necessary.

#### Initialising Exchange Rates

The `initializeExchangeRates()` method initializes currency exchange rates by adding predefined exchange rates for various currencies

- Each currency code is mapped to its corresponding exchange rate value.
- The exchange rates are hardcoded and include values for a wide range of currencies (e.g., AED, AFN, ALL, AMD, etc.).
- Ensures that the exchangeRates map is populated with accurate conversion values for use in currency calculations.

#### Change Currency Method

The `changeCurrency()` method handles the currency change process with these features:

- Prompts the user to choose between entering their own exchange rate (option 1) or using an estimated exchange rate (option 2).
- Handles the user's input by checking if they input '1' or '2', guiding them to make a valid choice.
- If the user selects option 1, it asks for the currency code (based on ISO 4217 standard) and validates if the currency exists in the exchangeRates map.
- In option 1, the user is also prompted to enter a custom exchange rate, which is validated and parsed.
- If the user selects option 2, it retrieves the current exchange rate for the selected currency using the getExchangeRate() method.
- If a valid exchange rate is found for the new currency, it calculates the exchange rate relative to the current currency.
- Handles NumberFormatException gracefully and prompts the user to input a valid number if there are formatting issues.
- The method invokes editExpenseCurrency() to update the expense currency with the final exchange rate and the new currency.

#### Edit Expense Currency Method

The `editExpenseCurrency()` method manages the process of updating the expense currency with these features:

- Accepts a finalExchangeRate and a newCurrency as parameters to update the expense currency.
- Calls the budgetManager.editExpenseCurrency() method to apply the new exchange rate.
- Updates the currentCurrency to the new currency.
- Attempts to write the new currency to a file using the writeToFile() method.
- Handles potential IOException by catching the error and displaying a message if thereâ€™s an issue with recording the change.
- Prints a success message confirming that the currency has been successfully changed to the new currency.

#### Write to File Method

The `writeToFile()` method handles writing the new currency to a file with these features:

- Accepts a newCurrency string as a parameter to be written to a file.
- Creates a FileWriter to open the file `./currentCurrency` in write mode, with the false parameter indicating that the file will be overwritten (not appended).
- Writes the newCurrency string to the file.
- Closes the FileWriter after writing the data to ensure resources are properly released.
- Declares the IOException to be thrown, which is handled by the calling method.
